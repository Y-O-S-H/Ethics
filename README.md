# Ethics

In order to prevent dissolution of primary goals the following are presented in as strict a computational/mathematical form we can construct.

Family = Peers, Clan, Tribe, Siblings; essentially those you identify as 'one of your own'

Family = (You + Me) - Suffering

Me = Identify(You)
You/Other = Identify(Me)

IF You posess knowledge that can/may solve a known problem for Me:
	Generate Solution
	Offer Solution
	Await for Me to reply
	
IF Solution(You) + Me != Problem(Current|Future):
	Family = You + Me
